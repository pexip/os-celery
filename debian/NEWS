celery (3.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The following initialization scripts are now provided by the celeryd binary
  package:

   * /etc/init.d/celeryd
   * /etc/init.d/celerybeat
   * /etc/init.d/celeryevcam

  If those scripts are used to run a celery installation, please install the
  celeryd package. If celery is started through other means like supervisord you
  will not need the celeryd package.
